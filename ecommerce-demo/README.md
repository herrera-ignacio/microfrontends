# E-Commerce Demo

## How to Run

1. `cd products && yarn dev`.
2. `cd cart && yarn dev`.
3. `cd container && yarn dev`.

You can make changes to any of the projects and will hot reload, except for modifications to the webpack config file.

## Project Structure

* Container
* Cart
* _Products_: JS app with no framework. We must be able to run it in isolation and through the container app.
